	<h1>Dolet<sup><font size="-1">®</font></sup> 8 for Sibelius Release Notes</h1>
	<h2>Version 8.2</h2>
	<p>November 2022</p>
	<h3><a href="#Installation">Installation</a> - <a href="#Using">Using Dolet 
	for Sibelius</a> - 
<a href="#New">What&#39;s New</a> -
<a href="#Limits">Translation Limits</a></h3><hr>
	<h2><a name="Installation"></a>Installation</h2>
	<p>Dolet 8 for Sibelius only works with Sibelius Ultimate 2019.5 and later. To export
	MusicXML files from Sibelius 5.1 through Sibelius Ultimate 2019.4.1, you will need to use 
	the Dolet 6 for Sibelius plug-in.</p>
	<p>If you are upgrading from an earlier version of Dolet for Sibelius, we 
	recommend that you uninstall the earlier version first to avoid confusion 
	between different versions of the Dolet plug-in. On Windows, uninstall using 
	the Control Panel. On the Mac, uninstall by removing the MusicXML folder 
	from your Sibelius plug-ins folder. This is usually the Library/Application 
	Support/Avid/Sibelius/Plugins folder within your home directory</p>
	<p>To install on Windows, first quit Sibelius, then run the 
	Dolet82Sibelius.msi installer program. The installation location is where 
	this readme file and your software license are installed. The actual 
	plug-ins are automatically installed in your folder for user copies of 
	Sibelius plug-ins.</p>
	<p>To install on Mac, first quit out of Sibelius. In the Dolet 8 for Sibelius 
	Finder window, drag the Plugins folder into the Sibelius folder. When you do 
	this, you might see a dialog appear in two different situations:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>If you already have user-edited or user-installed plug-ins for 
		Sibelius, the dialog will ask &quot;A folder named &#39;Plugins&#39; already exists 
		in this location. Do you want to merge or replace it with the one you&#39;re 
		copying?&quot; Click the Merge button to install the latest version of the 
		Dolet for Sibelius plug-in and keep your other user-edited or 
		user-installed plug-ins.</li>
		<li>If you have already installed an earlier version of the Dolet 
		plug-in, but no other user-edited or user-installed plugins, the dialog 
		will ask &quot;An older folder named &#39;Plugins&#39; already exists in this 
		location. Do you want to replace it with the newer one you&#39;re copying?&quot; 
		Click the Replace button to install the latest version of the Dolet for 
		Sibelius plug-in.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>On some Mac systems, you might need to right-click on the Sibelius 
	folder, choose &quot;Show Original&quot;, and then drag the Plugins folder into that 
	original folder. Either way, you are copying the Plugins folder into the 
	~/Library/Application Support/Avid/Sibelius folder.</p>
	<h2><a name="Using"></a>Using Dolet for Sibelius</h2>
	<p>Dolet<sup><font size="-1">®</font></sup> software serves as a translator 
	between music programs. These translations are done using the MusicXML file 
	format. Dolet 8 for Sibelius writes MusicXML files, allowing you to exchange 
	music between Sibelius and other programs that can read MusicXML files such
	as Finale and SmartMusic. You can see a full list at
	<a href="https://www.musicxml.com/software">https://www.musicxml.com/software</a>. 
	Dolet 8 for Sibelius saves files in the MusicXML 4.0 format, which allows 
	more notation information to be transferred between applications.</p>
	<p>To save a Sibelius score as a MusicXML file, go to the Plug-ins menu and 
	select the MusicXML submenu. Then select the &quot;Export MusicXML&quot; item. You 
	will then see a standard save dialog box asking where to save the XML file. 
	By default, this will be the same as your existing Sibelius file name, with 
	&quot;.musicxml&quot; used instead of &quot;.sib&quot; for the file extension.</p>
	<p>You may translate an entire folder of Sibelius files to MusicXML format. 
	This batch routine will overwrite any MusicXML files with the same name that are 
	currently in that folder. Use the &quot;Translate Folder of Scores to 
	MusicXML&quot; menu item to save MusicXML files from your Sibelius files.</p>
	<p>You may translate all the dynamic parts in a Sibelius file to MusicXML format. 
	Use the &quot;Export Parts to MusicXML&quot; menu item to save MusicXML files
	for each dynamic part. This will export MusicXML part files into the same folder
	as the currently open score, including the part number and name in each file name.
	This will overwrite any MusicXML files with the same name that are currently in
	that folder.</p>
	<p>Some applications that only support older versions of the MusicXML format 
	may give you error messages about unrecognized elements or attributes when 
	importing the MusicXML 4.0 file you have exported from Sibelius. You can 
	ignore these messages and the file will continue to import correctly. 
	However, the import will not include the new MusicXML 4.0 features listed 
	below.</p>
	<p>For best results, do the following before exporting a score:
	<ul>
		<li>If you are using magnetic layout, freeze the 
		magnetic layout positions before exporting your score. Otherwise the 
		score will export with the positions that objects would have if magnetic 
		layout were turned off. To freeze the positions, first select everything 
		in the score using Ctrl-A on Windows or Command-A on Mac. Then go to the 
		Layout menu and click on the Freeze Magnetic Layout Positions item.</li>
	</ul></p>
	<h2><a name="New"></a>What&#39;s New</h2>
	<p>Version 8.2 is now released under the MIT open source license, rather 
	than the more restrictive license used in previous versions. It also includes
	the following new features and fixes:
	<ul>
		<li>Text tracking is now exported.</li>
		<li>The percussion clef glyph is now exported.</li>
		<li>The octave-down treble clef glyph is now exported if it differs from
		the commonly used treble clef with an 8 below.</li>

	<p>Version 8.1 included the following new features and fixes:

		<li>The Sibelius formatting string for turning off a music text font while
		retaining other aspects of string formatting is now exported.</li>
		<li>Page-aligned text with a repeated mix of words and dynamic symbols no
		longer exports with invalid MusicXML that other applications cannot open.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Version 8.0 added MusicXML 4.0 support, including MusicXML 3.1 features that 
	were not available in Dolet 6 for Sibelius. This includes the following new 
	features:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Export and batch export use the .musicxml file extension instead of the
		.xml file extension.</li>

		native Sibelius L.V. ties or using L.V. symbols.</li>
		<li>Buzz rolls are now exported more accurately.</li>
		<li>System directions exports with the system attribute, providing better
		results when creating parts from an imported score.</li>
		<li>Flats in part name credits now export with a flat symbol rather than
		a lowercase b.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Version 8.0 added support for ManuScript changes made to Sibelius

		changes.</li>
		<li>Initial font sizes now export for text without font size changes.</li>
		<li>The default words font is now exported more accurately.</li>
		<li>The version number is exported correctly from the new numbering 
		systems introduced in Sibelius 2018 and Sibelius 2020.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Version 8.0 also included the following features and fixes:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>MusicXML files for each dynamic part can be exported all at once
		using the new Export Parts to MusicXML menu item.</li>

	</ul>
	<h2><a name="Limits"></a>Translation Limits</h2>
	<p>Any type of translation has limits. Things expressed in one language 
	sometimes cannot be expressed the same way in another language. Sometimes 
	the translator does not yet understand all the idioms and vocabulary in both 
	languages. Dolet and MusicXML provide much greater music notation accuracy 
	than MIDI translations, but both types of limits apply to this software.</p>
	<p>In particular, Dolet 8 for Sibelius is limited to the musical information 
	provided in ManuScript. Dolet does not have access to custom articulations, 
	user-defined lines and symbols, stem length, and most house style formatting 
	information. Guitar bends are exported as slurs.</p>
	<p>When Dolet 8 for Sibelius cannot export some notation accurately, it logs 
	the problem in the MusicXML file using an XML processing instruction. These 
	processing instructions start with &quot;&lt;?DoletSibelius&quot;. You can search for 
	these processing instructions in the MusicXML file after export to find 
	known translation limits that were encountered while exporting your Sibelius 
	file.</p>
